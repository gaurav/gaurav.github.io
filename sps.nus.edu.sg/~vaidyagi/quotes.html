  	<dd><p>All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life’s heart.
  But if in your fear you would seek only love's peace and love's pleasure, then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love’s threshing floor, into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears. 
  		-- <u>Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet</u>
  
  	<dd><p>In this yogi-ridden age, it is too readily assumed that "non-attachment" is not only better than a full acceptance of earthly life, but that the ordinary man only rejects it because it is too difficult: in other words, that the average human being is a failed saint. It is doubtful whether this is true. Many people genuinely do not wish to be saints, and it is probable that some who achieve or aspire to sainthood have never felt much temptation to be human beings. If one could follow it to its psychological roots, one would, I believe, find that the main motive for "non-attachment" is a desire to escape from the pain of living, and above all from love, which, sexual or non-sexual, is hard work. But it is not necessary here to argue whether the other-worldly or the humanistic ideal is "higher". The point is that they are incompatible. One must choose between God and Man, and all "radicals" and "progressives," from the mildest Liberal to the most extreme Anarchist, have in effect chosen Man. -- <u>George Orwell, <i><a href="http://www.k-1.com/Orwell/index.cgi/work/essays/ghandi.html">Reflections on Gandhi</a></i></u>

          <dd><p> When love beckons to you, follow him, though his ways are hard and steep. And when his wings enfold you yield to him,   
  though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. And when he speaks to you believe in him, though his voice may shatter your    
  dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.

  	<dd><p>Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself. But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires: to melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night. To know the pain of too much tenderness. To be wounded by your own understanding of love; and to bleed willingly and joyfully. To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving; to rest at the noon hour and meditate love’s ecstasy; to return home at eventide with gratitude; and then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.

  	<br>We started out bitching about how little doctors know (egoistically, I think I know more than most doctors I've met) and how expensive NUH is...and suddenly someone burst out saying that it was such a waste of money prolonging a life for a paltry few miserable months.

  <a name="programming"><p><b>Programming</b>
  <dl>
  	<dd><p>An anecdote from IBM's Yorktown Heights Research Center.  When a
  programmer used his new computer terminal, all was fine when he was 
  sitting down, but he couldn't log in to the system when he was standing up.  That
  behavior was 100 percent repeatable: he could always log in when sitting
  and never when standing.
  	<br>Most of us just sit back and marvel at such a story; how could that  
  terminal know whether the poor guy was sitting or standing?  Good debuggers,
  though, knew that there has to be a reason.  Electrical theories are the easiest
  to hypothesize: was there a loose with under the carpet, or problems with  
  static electricity?  But electrical problems are rarely consistently
  reproducible.
  An alert IBMer finally noticed that the problem was in the terminal's
  keyboard: the tops of two keys were switched.  When the programmer was seated he was
  a touch typist and the problem went unnoticed, but when he stood he was led
  astray by hunting and pecking.

                  -- <u>Seymour Papert</u>
  
  	<dd><p>"Now wait", he interrupted before Richard even had a chance to start, "don't
  	I vaguely remember that you had some sort of computer when you were here? When was it?
  	1977?"<br>
  	"Well, what we called a computer in 1977 was really a kind of electric abacus, but ..."<br>
  	"Oh, now, don't underestimate the abacus," said Reg, "In skilled hands it's a very
  	sophisticated calculating device. Furthermore it requires no power, can be made with any
  	materials you have in hand, and never goes bing in the middle of an important piece of
  	work."<br>
  	"So an electric one would be particularly pointless," said Richard.<br>
  	"True enough," conceded Reg.<br>
  	"There really wasn't a lot this machine could do that you couldn't do yourself in half
  	the time with a lot less trouble," said Richard, "but it was, on the other hand, very
  	good at being a slow and dim-witted pupil."<br>
  	Reg looked at him quizzically.<br>
  	"I had no idea they were supposed to be in short supply," he said. "I could hit a dozen
  	with a bread roll from where I'm sitting."<br> 
  	"I'm sure. But look at it this way. What really is the point of trying to
  	teach anything to anybody?"<br>
  	This question seemed to provoke a murmur of sympathetic approval from up and down 
  	the table.<br>
  	Richard continued, "What I mean is that if you really want to understand something,
  	the best way is to try and explain it to someone else. That forces you to sort it out
  	in your own mind. And the more slow and dim-witted your pupil, the more you have to
  	break things down into more and more simple ideas. And that's really the essence of
  	programming. By the time you've sorted out a complicated idea into little steps that
  	even a stupid machine can deal with, you've certainly learned something about it
  	yourself. The teacher usually learns more than the pupil. Isn't that true?"<br>
  	"It would be hard to learn much less than my pupils", came a low growl from
  	somewhere on the table, "without undergoing a pre-frontal lobotomy."<br>

  <a name="beatles"><p><b>The Beatles</b>
  <dl>
  	<dd><p>[About <i>Not A Second Time</i>] ... it was one of the first
  	of the Beatles' songs to be subjected to critical analysis by a quality
  	newspaper. William Mann, then music critic of <i>The Times</i> (London),
  	compared part of it to Gustav Mahler's 'Song of the Earth'. John would
  	later say that this review was responsible for "starting the whole
  	intellectual bit about the Beatles".
  	<p>"Harmonic interest is typical of their quicker songs too," Mann
  	wrote, "and one gets the impression that they think simultaneously of
  	harmony and melody, so firmly are the major tonic sevenths and nineths
  	built into their tunes, and the flat-submediant key-switches, so
  	natural is the Aeolian cadence at the end of 'Not A Second Time'..."
  	John's comment on this was, "I didn't know what the hell it was all
  	about". Another time he said that he thought Aeolian cadences sounded
  	like exotic birds.

By and by, as the days and weeks go on, first he misses this, then that, then the other thing. And when he casts about for it he finds that it was in that house. Always it is an essential--there was but one of its kind. It cannot be replaced. It was in that house.

The day you bury him is a day of chores and crowds, of hands false or true to be shaken, of the immediate cares of mourning. The dead friend will not really die until tomorrow, when silence is round you again. Then he will show himself complete, as he was--to tear himself away, as he was, from the substantial you. Only then will you cry out because of him who is leaving and whom you cannot detain.
