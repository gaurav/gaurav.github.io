  <!-- Life -->
  	<p>If the path be beautiful, let us not ask where it leads.
  	<br><b>Anatole France</b>
  
  	<p>Life is worth living because the world is worth understanding.
  
  	<p>For if there is a sin against life, it consists perhaps not so much in<br>
  	despairing of life as in hoping for another life and in eluding the<br>
  	implacable grandeur of this life.
  	<br><b>Albert Camus</b>
  
  <!-- The meaning of life -->
  	<p>If man hasn't discovered something that he will die for, he isn't fit to live.
  	<br><b>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</b>
  	
  	<p>Do not seek death; death will find you. But seek the road which makes death a fulfillmeant.
  	<br><b>Dag Hammarskjold</b>
  
  <!-- The best things in life -->
  	<p>It's a magical world, Hobbes, ol' buddy ... Let's go exploring!
  	<br><b>Calvin, <i>It's a Magical World</i></b>
  
  	<p>Do not believe in miracles -- rely on them.
  
  	<p>Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop to look once in awhile, you could miss it.
  	<br><b>Ferris Beuller, <i>Ferris Beuller's Day Off</i></b>
  
  <!-- The worst things in life -->
  	<p>Accept that some days you are the pigeon and some days the 
  	statue.
  
  	<p>There was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.
  	<br><b>O.Henry, <i>The Gift of the Magi</i></b>
  
  	<p>Your life would be very empty if you had nothing to regret.
  
  	<p>So many people tiptoe through life, so carefully, to arrive, safely, at death
  
  	<p>Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing.
  	<br><b>Helen Keller</b>
  	
  	<p>Everybody has their moment of great opportunity in life. If you happen to miss the one you care about, everything else in life becomes eerily easy.
  	<br><b>Douglas Adams, <i>Mostly Harmless</i></b>
  	
  <!-- How to live your life -->
  	<p>During the voyage of life, remember to keep an eye out for a fair wind; batten down during a storm; hail all passing ships; and fly your colors proudly.
  	
  	<p>The essence of being human is that one does not seek perfection, that one is sometimes willing to commit sins for the sake of loyalty, that one does not push asceticism to the point where it makes friendly intercourse impossible, and that one is prepared in the end to be defeated and broken up by life, which is the inevitable price of fastening one's love upon other human individuals. No doubt alcohol, tobacco, and so forth, are things that a saint must avoid, but sainthood is also a thing that human beings must avoid.
  	<br><b>George Orwell, <i>Reflections on Gandhi</i></b>
  
  	<p>Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.
  	<br><b>Mahatma Gandhi</b>
  
  	<p>Never let the fear of striking out get in your way.
  	<br><b>Babe Ruth</b>
  
  	<p>When you lose, do not lose the lesson.
  	<br><b>The Dalai Lama</b>
  
  	<p>Live in a world of your own, but always welcome visitors.
  
  	<p>Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds you plant.
  	<br><b>Robert Louis Stevenson</b>
  
  	<p>I wanted a perfect ending. Now I've learned, the hard way, that some poems don't rhyme, and some stories don't have a clear beginning, middle, and end. Life is about not knowing, having to change, taking the moment and making the best of it, without knowing what's going to happen next. Delicious Ambiguity. 
  	<br><b>Gilda Radner</b>
  
  	<p>Ancient Egyptians believed that upon death they would be asked two questions and their answers would determine whether they could continue their journey in the afterlife. The first question was, "Did you bring joy?" The second was, "Did you find joy?"
  	<br><b>Leo Buscaglia</b>
