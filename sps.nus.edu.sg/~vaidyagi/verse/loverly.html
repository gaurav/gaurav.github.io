  <h2>Loverly</h2>
  <h3>From the soundtrack of <i>My Fair Lady</i></h3>
  <p>
  	All I want is a room somewhere<br>
  	Far away from the cold night air<br>
  	With one enormous chair<br>
  	Oh, wouldn't it be loverly<br>
  	<br>
  	Lots of choc'late for me to eat<br>
  	Lots of coal makin' lots of heat<br>
  	Warm face, warm hands, warm feet<br>
  	Oh, wouldn't it be loverly<br>
  	<br>
  	Oh, so loverly sitting abso-bloomin-loutely still<br>
  	I would never budge 'til spring krept over me windersill<br>
  	<br>
  	Someone's head restin' on my knee<br>
  	Warm and tender as he can be<br>
  	Who takes good care of me<br>
  	Oh, wouldn't it be loverly<br>
