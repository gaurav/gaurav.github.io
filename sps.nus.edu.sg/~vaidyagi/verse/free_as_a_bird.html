  <h1>Free As A Bird</h1>
  <h3><i>by</i> The Beatles</h3>
  
  <!-- written by hand, just to waste time ;) -->
  
  <p>Free as a bird<br>
  It's the next best thing to be<br>
  Free as a bird
  
  <p>Home, home and dry<br>
  Like a homing bird I'll fly<br>
  As a bird on wings
  
  <p>Whatever happened to<Br>
  The life that we once knew?<Br>
  Can we really live without each other?
  
  <p>Where did we lose the touch<br>
  That seemed to mean so much?<br>
  It always made me feel so ...
  
  <p>Free as a bird<Br>
  Like the next best thing to be<br>
  Free as a bird
  
  <p>Home, home and dry<br>
  Like a homing bird I'll fly<br>
  As a bird on wings
  
  <p>Whatever happened to<br>
  The life that we once knew?<br>
  Always made me feel so free
  
  <p>Ah...<br>
  Ah...<br>
  Ah...
  
  <p>Free as a bird<br>
  It's the next best thing to be<Br>
  Free as a bird<br>
  Free as a bird<br>
  Free as a bird<br>
  Oooooo<br>
  
  <p>Free...<br>
