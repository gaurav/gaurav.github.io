  copied by hand! Late one night (early morning, actually): 2:06am 5/12/2003. Yesterday was when I proposed to YKW, and today
  is the first time I heard these words, so appropriate enough, I suppose.

  <p>Every breath you take,<br>
  Every move you make,<br>
  Every bond you break,<Br>
  Every step you take,<br>
  I'll be watching you
  
  <p>Every single day<br>
  Every word you say<br>
  Every game you play<br>
  Every night you stay<br>
  I'll be watching you
  
  <p>O can't you see<br>
  You belong to me<br>
  How my poor heart aches with every step you take<br>
  
  <p>Every move you make<br>
  Every vow you break<br>
  Every smile you fake<br>
  Every claim you stake<br>
  I'll be watching you
  
  <p>Since you've gone<Br>
  I've been lost without a trace<br>
  I dream at night<br>
  I can only see your face<Br>
  I look around<br>
  But it's you I can't replace<br>
  I keep crying, baby, please
  
  <p>Every move you make<br>
  Every vow you break<br>
  Every smile you fake<br>
  Every claim you stake<br>
  I'll be watching you
