  <h1>You've Got To Hide Your Love Away</h1>
  <h3>by The Beatles</h3>
  
  <p>Here I stand head in hand<br>
  Turn my face to the wall<br>
  If she's gone I can't go on<br>
  Feelin' two-foot small
  
  <p>Everywhere people stare<br>
  Each and every day<br>
  I can see them laugh at me<br>
  And I hear them say
  
  <p>Hey you've got to hide your love away<br>
  Hey you've got to hide your love away
  
  <p>How could I even try<br>
  I can never win<br>
  Hearing them, seeing them<br>
  In the state I'm in
  
  <p>How could she say to me<br>
  Love will find a way<br>
  Gather round all you clowns<br>
  Let me hear you say
  
  <p>Hey you've got to hide your love away<br>
  Hey you've got to hide your love away
