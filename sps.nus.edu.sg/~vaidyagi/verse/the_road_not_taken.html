  <h2>The Road Not Taken</h2>
  <h3>Robert Frost</h3>
  <p>
  	Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
  	And sorry I could not travel both<br>
  	And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
  	And looked down one as far as I could<br>
  	To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
  	Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
  	And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
  	Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
  	Though as for that the passing there<br>
  	Had worn them really about the same,<br>
  	<br>
  	And both that morning equally lay<br>
  	In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
  	Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
  	Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
  	I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
  	<br>
  	I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
  	Somewhere ages and ages hence;<br>
  	Two roads diverged in a wood, and I --<br>
  	I took the one less traveled by,<Br>
  	And that has made all the difference.<br>
