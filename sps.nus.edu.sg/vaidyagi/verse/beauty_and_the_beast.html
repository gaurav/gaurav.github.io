  <h1>Beauty and the Beast</h1>
  <h3>From the Disney feature <i>Beauty and the Beast</i></h3>
  
  <p>Tale as old as time<br>
  True as it can be<br>
  Barely even friends<br>
  Then somebody bends<br>
  Unexpectedly<br>
  Just a little change<br>
  Small to say the least<br>
  Both a little scared<br>
  Neither one prepared<br>
  Beauty and the Beast
  
  <p>Ever just the same<br>
  Ever a surprise<br>
  Ever as before<br>
  Ever just as sure<br>
  As the sun will rise
  
  <p>Tale as old as time<br>
  Tune as old as song<br>
  Bittersweet and strange<br>
  Finding you can change<br>
  Learning you were wrong<br>
  Certain as the sun<br>
  Rising in the east<br>
  Tale as old as time<br>
  Song as old as rhyme<br>
  Beauty and the Beast
  
  <p>Tale as old as time<br>
  Song as old as rhyme<br>
  Beauty and the Beast
