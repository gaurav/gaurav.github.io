  <h1>Something To Talk About</h1>
  <h3>by Badly Drawn Boy</h3>
  
  <!-- copy/paste lah! -->
  <p>I've been dreaming<br>
  Of the things I've learnt about a boy<br>
  Whose bleeding, celebrate to elevate<br>
  The joy is not the same without the pain
  
  <p>Ipso facto<Br>
  Using up your oxygen, you know I'm shallow<br>
  Calling out for extra help<br>
  You've got to let me in or let me out
  
  <p>Oh something to talk about<br>
  Yeah something to talk about
  
  <p>I've been dreaming of the things I've learnt about a boy<br>
  Whose leaving, nothing else to chance again<br>
  You've got to let me in or let me out
  
  <p>Oh something to talk about<br>
  Yeah something to talk about
