  <h1>The Final Frontier (Mad About You)</h1>
  <h3>from the TV show <i>Mad About You</i></h3>
  
  <p>Tell me why<br>
  I love you like I do<br>
  Tell me who<br>
  Can stop my heart as much as you<br>
  Tell me all your secrets<br>
  And I'll tell you most of mine<br>
  They say nobody's perfect<br>
  But that's really true this time<br>
  I don't have the answers<br>
  I don't have a plan<br>
  All I have is you, so darlin' help me understand
  
  <p>What we do<br>
  (You can whisper in my ears)<br>
  Where we go<br>
  (Who knows what happens after here?)<br>
  Let's take each other's hand<br>
  As we jump into the final frontier
  
  <p>Mad about you, baby, yeah,<br>
  I'm mad about you
