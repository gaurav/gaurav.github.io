  <h1>Make Me A Channel Of Your Peace</h1>
  <h3>Based on a prayer by St. Francis</h3>
  
  <p>Make me a channel of your peace,<br>
  Where there is hatred, let me bring Your love,<br>
  Where there is injury, Your pardon Lord,<br>
  And where there's doubt, true faith in You
  
  <p>Make me a channel of your peace,<br>
  Where there's despair in life let me bring hope,<br>
  Where there is darkness - only light,<br>
  And where there's sadness, ever joy
  
  <p>Oh Master, grant that I may never seek,<br>
  So much to be consoled as to console,<br>
  To be understood, as to understand,<br>
  To be loved, as to love with all my soul
  
  <p>Make me a channel of your peace,<br>
  It is in pardoning that we are pardoned,<Br>
  In giving to all men that we recieve,<br>
  And in dying that we're born to eternal life
