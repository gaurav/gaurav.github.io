  <p>Kiss me out of the bearded barley<br>
  Nightly, beside the green, green grass.<br>
  Swing, swing, swing the spinning step.<br>
  You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress.
  
  <p>Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight.<br>
  Lead me out on the moonlit floor.<br>
  Lift your open hand.<br>
  Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance,<br>
  silver moon's sparkling.<br>
  So kiss me.
  
  <p>Kiss me down by the broken tree house.<br>
  Swing me upon its hanging tire.<br>
  Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat.<br>
  We'll take the trail marked on your father's map.
