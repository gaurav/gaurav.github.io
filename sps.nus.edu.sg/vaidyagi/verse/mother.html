  <h3>by John Lennon</h3>
  
  <!-- c&p -->
  <p>Mother, you had me, but I never had you<br>
  I wanted you, you didn't want me<br>
  So I, I just got to tell you<br>
  Goodbye<br>
  Goodbye
  
  <p>Father, you left me, but I never left you<br>
  I needed you, you didn't need me<br>
  So I, I just got to tell you<Br>
  Goodbye<br>
  Goodbye
  
  <p>Children, don't do what I have done<br>
  I couldn't walk and I tried to run<br>
  So I, I just got to tell you<br>
  Goodbye<br>
  Goodbye
  
  <p>Mama don't go<br>
  Daddy come home<br>
