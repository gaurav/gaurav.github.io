  <h1>My Favorite Things</h1>
  <h3>From <i>The Sound of Music</i></h3>
  
  <p>Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens,<br>
  Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens,<br>
  Brown paper packages, tied up with strings,<br>
  These are a few of my favourite things
  
  <p>Cream coloured ponies and crisp apple streudels,<br>
  Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles,<br>
  Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings,<br>
  These are a few of my favourite things
  
  <p>Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes,<br>
  Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes,<br>
  Silver white winters that melt into Spring,<br>
  These are a few of my favourite things
  
  <p>When the dog bites,<br>
  When the bee stings,<br>
  When I'm feeling sad,<br>
  I simply remember my favourite things<br>
  And then I don't feel so bad
