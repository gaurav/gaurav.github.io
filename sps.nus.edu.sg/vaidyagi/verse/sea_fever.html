  <h1>Sea Fever</h1>
  <h3>by John Masefield</h3>
  
  <!-- Copied and pasted after having seen this in Shruti's poetry book -->
  
  <p>I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky,<br>
  And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by,<br>
  And the wheel's kick and the wind's song and the white sail's shaking,<br>
  And a gray mist on the sea's face, and a gray dawn breaking.
  
  <p>I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide<br>
  Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied;<br>
  And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying,<br>
  And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.
  
  <p>I must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life,<br>
  To the gull's way and the whale's way, where the wind's like a whetted knife;<br>
  And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover,<br>
  And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick's over.
