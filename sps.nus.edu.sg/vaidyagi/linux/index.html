  <p><img align=left src="linux_logo.gif" />Linux was created by <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/torvalds/">Linus Torvalds</a>, then an
  undergraduate student at the University of Helsinki in Finland. After much, much, <b>much</b> work by countless
  developers around the world, this home-made OS for PCs has hit the limelight, as the only (credible!) competition
  faced by <a href="windows.html">Microsoft Windows</a> (known as The Herald of The Evil Empire by countless hackers, see 
  <a href="http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20030329">here</a>). Competition is good; ask Charles Darwin for details.
  <p>Just a bit of warning, though - Linux <i>is</i> a hacker's OS. You will have to learn much if you're migrating from Windows
  to Linux. You will have to understand your computer better than you do now. You will have to work at things which would happen
  <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/A/automagically.html">automagically</a> in Windows - and you will have to strive on
  if you want to get your camera/mouse/CD-ROM/hard-disk working, knowing that a simple reboot, reformat, and reinstall of Windows
  will solve all your problems. Most importantly, you will have ExtraOrdinary Power at your hands - a simple mistake in a tiny
  text file, and all that power could chop your hard-disk into tiny pieces that will fall out from the bottom of your computer (or
  something equally scary). The <a href="../programming/index.html">C Programming Language</a>, it is said, gives you enough rope to hang
  yourself. With Linux, the rope becomes a chainsaw.
  <p>All it takes, naturally, is practice. A little while screwing around with computer internals, man-ing (type 'man man' into any
  Linux/Unix shell prompt to see what I mean), and a great many words with your local Linux guru, and soon you too will understand.
  And suddenly that chainsaw will be a toy; something you can use to chop up trees in your spare time. 
  <p>Of course, there are all those many things you will have to give up on. Paying tons of money for programming tools, scientific applications,
  databases and web servers, for instance. The <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSOD">Blue Screen Of Death</a>. User support?
  If you have a problem you can't solve, you can <a href="http://www.google.org/linux/">Google</a> for it - generally, you'll find it on a
  discussion board <i>somewhere</i>. There are those who argue that learning a bit more about your computer isn't entirely a bad thing either.
  Happy Hacking!
