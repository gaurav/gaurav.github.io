  <!-- What is a friend? -->
  	<p>A friend is someone who knows the song in your heart, and can sing it back to you when you have forgotten the words.
  
  	<p>A friend is one<br>
  	To whom one may pour out all<br>
  	The contents of one's heart<br>
  	Chaff and grain, together,<br>
  	Knowing that the gentlest of hands<br>
  	Will take and sift it,<br>
  	Keep what's worth<Br>
  	And blow the rest away
  	
  	<p>Your friend is your needs answered. He is your field which you sow with love and reap with thanksgiving. And he is your board and your fireside. For you come to him with your hunger, and you seek him for peace.
  	<br> <b>Kahlil Gibran, <i>The Prophet</i></b>

  <!-- To my friends -->
  	<p>My friend, if I could give you one thing, I would wish for you the ability to see yourself as others see you. Then you would realize what a truly special person you are. 	
  
  	<p>Help me if you can, I'm feeling down<br>
  	And I do appreciate your being around<br>
  	Help me get my feet back on the ground<br>
  	Won't you please, please, help me
  	<br><b>The Beatles, <i>Help!</i></b>
  
  <!-- Final points -->
  	<p>Go slowly to the entertainments of thy friends, but quickly to their misfortunes.
  	<br> <b>Chilo</b>
