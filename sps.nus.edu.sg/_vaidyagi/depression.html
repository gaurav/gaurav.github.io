  		<h2>Dealing with Depression</h2>
  		<p>Try:
  		<ol>
  			<li>Check out my <a href="quotes.html">Quotes</a> page. I'm a pretty depressive guy,
  			so I try to collect anti-depressivy kinda stuff.
  			<li>Search the `net for poems. Check out <a href="http://www.robertfrost.org/books.html">these Robert Frost</a> poems - or even better, try <a href="http://www.vasudevaserver.com/home/sites/poetseers.org/html/modernpoets/robert_frost/library/the_road_not_taken">check out this one</a>.
  			<li>Go onto <a href="http://messenger.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Messenger</a> (NOT <a href="http://gaim.sf.net/">Gaim</a>, which is almost as good - AND free, both as in beer and speech!). Find a friend (force them to download Messenger if you have to, if friends aren't around when you need 'em what <i>are</i> they good for?). Put on voice chat. Load the Doodle IMvironment (click the IMV... button and figure it out, dumbo). Loose yourself :).
  			<li>Bug people about it. 2x=)
  			<li>Hang out with loose friends, and loose yourself. Hang out with tight friends, and let them know.	 
  			<li>Visit <a href="http://www.teenadviceonline.org/">Teen Advice Online</a>. See what's happening in other people's life. Try to make a difference.
  			<li>Take a walk. Better yet, call a friend and walk with them.
  			<li>Sit back in a chair, look out the window, stare at the clouds. Slow down your mind until you are moving as slowly as those clouds are.
  
  			<li>Read my <a href="verse/index.html">verse</a> page. Sing along with the more jolly numbers. Start with 'Loverly'! =)
  			<li>Try some truth. Maybe <a href="http://www.tekwh0re.net/movabletype/archives/000313.php">this</a> will wake you up.
  			<li>Read <a href="http://www.idiotsavant.com/bueller/script.htm">Ferris Bueller's Day Off</a> - just to remind yourself that life (properly lived) can be worth it.
  			<li>Read <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/o_henry/1014/">The Gift of the Magi</a> by O.Henry (one of the best writers EVER!!!!). It's short, it's sweet, it's obvious (ah, well - can the Master perform every time?) but ... it's cool. For a laugh, you might try <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/o_henry/1024/">The Hypotheses Of Failure</a>.
  			<li>Read <a href="http://bau2.uibk.ac.at/sg/python/Scripts/LifeOfBrian/brian-08.html">Scene 8</a> of Monty Python's, "The Life of Brian" - commonly known as 'Romanes Eunt Domus' ...
  			<li>Read <A href="http://coral.lili.uni-bielefeld.de/Classes/Summer97/SemGS/WebLex/OldPossum/oldpossumlex/node2.html#SECTION00020000000000000000">this</a> out to yourself ... but ... really ... really ... slowly ...
  			<li>Nice page to read: <a href="http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_have_two_cows">from Wikipedia</a>
  			<li>Good article: <a href="http://sources.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_-_Helen_Keller">Optimism</a> by Helen Keller
  			<li>If all else fails, look up <a href="http://users.aristotle.net/~diogenes/meaning1.htm">the meaning of life</a>.
  			<li><b>If your depression is caused by computers</b>: <a href="http://sizzly.com/lastpage.htm">Click here</a>
  			<li><a href="http://www.mwscomp.com/sounds/mp3/brghtsd.mp3">ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE</a> [<a href="http://www.mwscomp.com/movies/brian/brian-31.htm">lyrics</a>] (by the same people who brought you the <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_who_say_Ni">Knights who say Ni</a>)
  	</ol>
  
  		<h3>What to do if a friend is depressed</h3>
  		<ol>
  			<li>Sometimes the best thing to do is to simply do nothing. Just be there for them. Sit with them and say nothing.
  			Let them work thru whatever's bugging them; all you've got to give is support. Cos sometimes it's enough.
  		</ol>
