  <h1>Jealous Guy</h1>
  <h3>by John Lennon</h3>
  
  <p>I was dreamin' of the past<br>
  And my heart was beating fast<br>
  I began to loose control<Br>
  I began to loose control<br>
  I didn't mean to hurt you<br>
  I'm sorry that<br>
  I made you cry<br>
  I didn't want to hurt you<Br>
  I'm just a jealous guy
  
  <p>I was feelin' insecure<br>
  You might not love me anymore<br>
  I was shivering inside<br>
  I was shivering inside<br>
  I didn't mean to hurt you<br>
  I'm sorry that<br>
  I made you cry<br>
  I didn't want to hurt you<br>
  I'm just a jealous guy
  
  <p>I was trying to catch your eyes<br>
  Thought that you was trying to hide<br>
  I was swallowing my pain<Br>
  I was swallowing my pain<br>
  I didn't mean to hurt you<br>
  I'm sorry that I made you cry<br>
  I didn't want to hurt you<br>
  I'm just a jealous guy<br>
  I'm just a jealous guy (watch out, baby)<br>
  I'm just a jealous guy (look out, baby)<br>
  I'm just a jealous guy
