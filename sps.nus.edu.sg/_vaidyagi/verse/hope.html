  <h1>Part One: Life, Song XXXII</h1>
  <h2>Emily Dickenson</h2>
  
  <p>Hope is the thing with feathers<br>	
  That perches in the soul,<br>
  And sings the tune without the words,<br>	
  And never stops at all,<br>
  
  <p>And sweetest in the gale is heard;<br>
  And sore must be the storm<br>
  That could abash the little bird<br>	
  That kept so many warm.<br>
      
  <p>I've heard it in the chillest land,<br>	
  And on the strangest sea;<br> 
  Yet, never, in extremity,<br>
  It asked a crumb of me.
