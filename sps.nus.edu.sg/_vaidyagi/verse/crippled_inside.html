  <h1>Crippled Inside</h1>
  <h3>by John Lennon</h3>
  
  <p>You can shine your shoes and wear a suit,<br>
  You can comb your hair and look quite cute,<br>
  You can hide your face behind a smile,<br>
  One thing you can't hide is when your crippled inside,
  
  <p>You can wear a mask and paint your face,<br>
  You can call youself the human race,<br>
  You can wear a collar and a tie,<br>
  One thing you can't hide is when you're crippled inside,
  
  <p>Well now you know that your cat has nine lives, babe,<br>
  Nine lives to itself,<br>
  But you only got one and a dog's life ain't fun,<br>
  Mamma take a look outside.
  
  <p>You can go to church and sing a hymn,<br>
  Judge me by the colour of my skin,<br>
  You can live a lie until you die,<br>
  One thing you can't hide is when you're crippled inside.
  
  <p>(repeat last two verses)
