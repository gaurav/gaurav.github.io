  <h1>For No One</h1>
  <h3>by The Beatles</h3>
  
  <!-- Typed out: Dec 31, 2003 -->
  
  <p>Your day breaks, your mind aches,<br>
  You find that all her words of kindness linger on<br>
  When she no longer needs you
  
  <p>She wakes up, she makes up,<br>
  She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry<br>
  She no longer needs you
  
  <p>And in her eyes you see nothing,<Br>
  No sign of love behind the tears<br>
  Cried for no one<br>
  A love that should have lasted years!
  
  <p>You stay home, she goes out,<br>
  She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone<Br>
  She doesn't need him
  
  <p>Your day breaks, your mind aches,<br>
  There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head<br>
  You won't forget her
  
  <p>And in her eyes you see nothing,<br>
  No sign of love behind the tears<br>
  Cried for no one<br>
  A love that should have lasted years!
