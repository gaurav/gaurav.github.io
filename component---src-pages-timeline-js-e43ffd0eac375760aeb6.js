To achieve this, I work with tools that use standards such as RDF and JSON-LD to store and transmit semantically rich data, use ontologies written in OWL to reason over data, and use descriptions in SHACL and ShEx to validate data and document data models. Where existing tools are unavailable or inadequate, I write software tools to fill this need. My current projects focus on genetic, disease and other biomedical data, but I look forward to working with other kinds of data in the future. I work primarily in Scala to build these tools."},{"@id":"#Postdoctoral-associate-the-Florida-Museum-of-Natural-History-at-Gainesville-Florida-USA","@type":"schema:RoleName","startDate":"2018-01-02","endDate":"2019-10-11","roleName":"Postdoctoral associate","organization":{"@id":"https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/","@type":"schema:Corporation","addThe":true,"name":"Florida Museum of Natural History","parentOrganization":{"@id":"https://www.ufl.edu/","@type":"schema:Corporation","addThe":true,"name":"University of Florida","location":"Gainesville, Florida, USA"},"location":"Gainesville, Florida, USA"},"description":"I worked full-time as the lead software developer on the Phyloreferencing project.
