  <h2>Annie's Song</h2>
  <h3>John Denver</h3>
  
  <p>You fill up my senses<br>
  Like a night in a forest<br>
  Like the mountains in springtime<br>
  Like a walk in the rain<br>
  Like a storm in the desert<br>
  Like a sleepy blue ocean<br>
  You fill up my senses<br>
  Come fill me again
  
  <p>Come let me love you<br>
  Let me give my life to you<br>
  Let me drown in your laughter<br>
  Let me die in your arms<br>
  Let me lay down beside you<br>
  Let me always be with you<br>
  Come let me love you<br>
  Come love me again
  
  <p>You fill up my senses<br>
  Like a night in a forest<br>
  Like the mountains in springtime<br>
  Like a walk in the rain<br>
  Like a storm in the desert<br>
  Like a sleepy blue ocean<br>
  You fill up my senses<br>
  Come fill me again
