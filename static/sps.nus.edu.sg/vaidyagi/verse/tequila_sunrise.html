  <h2>Tequila Sunrise</h2>
  <h3>The Eagles</h3>
  
  <p>It's another tequila sunrise<br>
  Starin' slowly 'cross the sky said goodbye<br>
  He was just a hired hand<br>
  Workin' on the dreams he planned to try<br>
  The days go by
  
  <p>Ev'ry night when the sun goes down<br>
  Just another lonely boy in town<br>
  And she's out runnin' 'round<br>
  
  <p>She wasn't just another woman<br>
  And I couldn't keep from comin' on<br>
  It's been so long<br>
  Oh and it's a hollow feelin' when<br>
  It comes down to dealin' friends<br>
  It never ends
  
  <p>Take another shot of courage<br>
  Wonder why the right words never come<br>
  You just get numb<br>
  It's another tequila sunrise, this old world<br>
  still looks the same,<br>
  Another frame, mm...
