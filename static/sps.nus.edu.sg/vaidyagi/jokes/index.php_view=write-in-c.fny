  When I find my code in tons of trouble,
  <br>Friends and colleagues come to me,
  <br>Speaking words of wisdom:
  <br>"Write in C."
  <br>
  <br>As the deadline fast approaches,
  <br>And bugs are all that I can see,
  <br>Somewhere, someone whispers:
  <br>"Write in C."
  <br>
  <br>Write in C, Write in C,
  <br>Write in C, oh, Write in C.
  <br>LOGO's dead and buried,
  <br>Write in C.
  <br>
  <br>I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
  <br>For science it worked flawlessly.
  <br>Try using it for graphics!
  <br>Write in C.
  <br>
  <br>If you've just spent nearly 30 hours
  <br>Debugging some assembly,
  <br>Soon you will be glad to
  <br>Write in C.
  <br>
  <br>Write in C, Write in C,
  <br>Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
  <br>Only wimps use BASIC.
  <br>Write in C.
  <br>
  <br>Write in C, Write in C
  <br>Write in C, oh, Write in C.
  <br>Pascal won't quite cut it.
  <br>Write in C.
  <br>
  <br>Write in C, Write in C,
  <br>Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
  <br>Don't even mention COBOL.
  <br>Write in C.
