  <h2>Lemon Tree</h2>
  <h3>Fool's Garden</h3>
  <p>
  	I'm sitting here, in a boring room<br>
  	It's just another lazy Sunday afternoon<br>
  	I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do<br>
  	I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you<br>
  	But nothing ever happens - and I wonder<br>
  	<br>
  	I'm driving around, in my car,<br>
  	I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far<br>
  	I'd like to change my point of view<br>
  	I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you<Br>
  	But nothing ever happens - and I wonder<br>
  	<Br>
  	I wonder how, I wonder why<br>
  	Yesterday you tole me 'bout the blue blue sky<br>
  	And all that I can see<br>
  	Is just a yellow lemon tree<br>
  	I'm turning my head up and down<br>
  	I'm turning turning turning turning turning around<br>
  	And all that I can see<br>
  	Is just a yellow lemon tree<br>
  	<br>
  	I'm sitting here, I miss the power<br>
  	I'd like to go out, taking a shower<br>
  	But there's a heavy cloud inside my head<br>
  	I feel so tired, put myself into bed<br>
  	Where nothing ever happens - and I wonder<br>
  	<br>
  	Isolation - is not good for me<br>
  	Isolation - I don't want to sit on a lemon tree<Br>
  	I'm steppin' around in a desert of joy<br>
  	Baby anyhow I'll get another toy<br>
  	And everything will happen - and you'll wonder<br>
  	<Br>
  	I wonder how, I wonder why<Br>
  	Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky<br>
  	And all that I can see<br>
  	Is just a yellow lemon tree<br>
  	I'm turning my head, up and down,<Br>
  	I'm turning turning turning turning turning around<br>
  	And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
