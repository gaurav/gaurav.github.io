  <!-- At the time of farewell -->
  	<p>A man's dying is more the survivors' affair than his own.
  	<br><b>Thomas Mann</b>
  
  	<p>On a day of burial there is no perspective--for space itself is annihilated. Your dead friend is still a fragmentary being. The day you bury him is a day of chores and crowds, of hands false or true to be shaken, of the immediate cares of mourning. The dead friend will not really die until tomorrow, when silence is round you again. Then he will show himself complete, as he was--to tear himself away, as he was, from the substantial you. Only then will you cry out because of him who is leaving and whom you cannot detain.
  	<br><b>Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</b>
  
  <!-- Leaving -->
  	<p>I answer the heroic question "Death, where is they sting?" with "It is here in my heart and mind and memories."
  	<br><b>Maya Angelou</b>
  	
  	<p>While we are mourning the loss of our friend, others are rejoicing to meet him behind the veil.
  	<br><b>John Taylor</b>
  
  	<p> A man's house burns down. The smoking wreckage represents only a ruined home that was dear through years of use and pleasant associations. By and by, as the days and weeks go on, first he misses this, then that, then the other thing. And when he casts about for it he finds that it was in that house. Always it is an essential--there was but one of its kind. It cannot be replaced. It was in that house. It is irrevocably lost...It will be years before the tale of lost essentials is complete, and not till then can he truly know the magnitude of his disaster.
  	<br><b>Mark Twain</b>
  
  	<p>Bereavement is a darkness impenetrable to the imagination of the unbereaved.
  	<br><b>Iris Murdoch</b>
  
  	<p>We who are left how shall we look again<br>
  	Happily on the sun or feel the rain<br>
  	Without remembering how they who went<br>
  	Ungrudgingly and spent<Br>
  	Their lives for us loved, too, the sun and rain?<br>
  	<b>Wilfred Wilson Gibson</b>
  
  <!-- but -->
  	<p>Tears are sometimes an inappropriate response to death. When a life has been lived completely honestly, completely successfully, or just completely, the correct response to death's perfect punctuation mark is a smile.
  	<br><b>Julie Burchill</b>
  
  <!-- Missing -->
  	<p>He who has gone, so we but cherish his memory, abides with us, more potent, nay, more present than the living man.
  	<br><b>Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</b> 
  
  	<p>Only nature has a right to grieve perpetually, for she only is innocent. Soon the ice will melt, and the blackbirds sing along the river which he frequented, as pleasantly as ever. The same everlasting serenity will appear in this face of God, and we will not be sorrowful, if he is not.
  	    <br><b>Henry David Thoreau</b> (upon the death of his brother) 
  
  	<p>Only those who have dared to let go can dare to reenter.
  	<br><b>Meister Eckhart</b>
