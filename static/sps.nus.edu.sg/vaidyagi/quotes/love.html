  	<p>"I hate fog. I am afraid of it."<br>
  	"That means you love it. You are afraid of it because it is stronger than you; you hate it because you are afraid of it; you love it because you cannot subdue it to your will. Only the unsubduable can be loved."

  	<p>That is the true season of love, when we believe that we alone can love, that no one could have loved so before us, and that no one will love in the same way as us.

  	Calvin: What's it like to fall in love?<br>
  	Hobbes: Well ... say the object of your affection walks by ...<br>
  	Calvin: Yeah?<br>
  	Hobbes: First, your heart falls into your stomach and splashes your innards.<Br>
  	All the moisture makes you sweat profusely.<br>
  	This condensation shorts the circuits to your brain, and you get all woozy.<Br>
  	When your brain burns out altogether, your mouth disengages and you babble like a cretin until she leaves.<Br>
  	Calvin: That's love?!?<br>
  	Hobbes: Medically speaking.<br>
  	Calvin: Heck, that happened to me once, but I figured it was cooties!!<br>

  	<p>I used to think romantic love was a neurosis shared by two, a supreme foolishness. I no longer thought that. There's nothing foolish in loving anyone. Thinking you'll be loved in return is what's foolish.

  	<p>We all become great explorers during our first few days in a new city, or a new love affair.
  	<br><b>Mignon McLaughlin</b>

  	<p>All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life's heart. But if in your fear you would seek only love's peace and love's pleasure, then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love's threshing floor, into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears.

  	<p>When love beckons to you, follow him, though his ways are hard and steep. And when his wings enfold you yield to him, though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. And when he speaks to you believe in him, though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.
  	<br><b>Kahlil Gibran, <i>The Prophet</i></b>

  	<centeR>
  	<p>Man is too thoroughly an egoist not to be also an egotist; if he love, the object shall know it. During a lifetime he may conceal it through stress of expediency and honour, but it shall bubble from his dying lips, though it disrupt a neighbourhood. It is known, however, that most men do not wait so long to disclose their passion. In the case of Lorison, his particular ethics positively forbade him to declare his sentiments, but he must needs dally with the subject, and woo by innuendo at least.

  	<p>If you love something, set it free. If it comes back to you, it is yours forever. If it flies away, it was never yours to begin with.
  	<br><b>Chinese proverb</b>

  	<p>You go slow, be gentle. It's no one-way street -- you know how you feel and that's all. It's how the girl feels too. Don't press. If the girl feels anything for you at all, you'll know.
  	<br><b>Kirk, <i>"Charlie X"</i>, stardate 1535.8</b>

  	<p>I have died many a death in love, and yet, had I not loved I would never have lived at all.

  	<p>Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself. But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires: to melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night. To know the pain of too much tenderness. To be wounded by your own understanding of love; and to bleed willingly and joyfully. To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving; to rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy; to return home at eventide with gratitude; and then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.
  	<br><b>Kahlil Gibran, <i>The Prophet</i></b>

  	<p>    In this yogi-ridden age, it is too readily assumed that "non-attachment" is not only better than a full acceptance of earthly life, but that the ordinary man only rejects it because it is too difficult: in other words, that the average human being is a failed saint. It is doubtful whether this is true. Many people genuinely do not wish to be saints, and it is probable that some who achieve or aspire to sainthood have never felt much temptation to be human beings. If one could follow it to its psychological roots, one would, I believe, find that the main motive for "non-attachment" is a desire to escape from the pain of living, and above all from love, which, sexual or non-sexual, is hard work. But it is not necessary here to argue whether the other-worldly or the humanistic ideal is "higher". The point is that they are incompatible. One must choose between God and Man, and all "radicals" and "progressives," from the mildest Liberal to the most extreme Anarchist, have in effect chosen Man.
