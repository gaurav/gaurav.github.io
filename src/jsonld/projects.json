Files for individual genes are dragged and dropped into a window and the sequences are concatenated. A table provides an overview over how much sequence information is available for the different genes and species. The user can request Sequence Matrix generate a wide variety of character and taxon sets (e.g. a taxon set with all species that have more than a specified number of genes or basepairs). The concatenated sequences can be exported in NEXUS or TNT format. Individual sequences can be excluded from being exported.",
