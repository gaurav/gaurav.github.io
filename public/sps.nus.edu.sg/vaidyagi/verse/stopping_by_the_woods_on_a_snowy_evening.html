  <h2>Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening</h2>
  <h3>Robert Frost</h3>
  <p>
  	Whose woods these are I think I know.<br>
  	His house is in the village though;<br>
  	He will not see me stopping here<br>
  	To watch his woods fill up with snow.<br>
  	My little horse must think it queer<br>
  	To stop without a farmhouse near<br>
  	Between the woods and frozen lake<br>
  	The darkest evening of the year.<br>
  	He gives his harness bells a shake<br>
  	To ask if there is some mistake.<br>
  	The only other sound's the sweep<br>
  	Of easy wind and downy flake.<br>
  	The woods are lovely, dark and deep.<br>
  	But I have promises to keep,<br>
  	And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
  	And miles to go before I sleep.
