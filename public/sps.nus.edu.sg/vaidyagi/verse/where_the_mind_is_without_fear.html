  <h1>Where The Mind Is Without Fear</h1>
  <h3>From <i>Gitanjali</i> by Rabindranath Tagore</h3>
  
  <p>Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;<br>
  where knowledge is free;<br>
  Where the world has not been broken up into fragments<br>
  by narrow domestic walls;<br>
  Where words come out from the depths of truth;<br>
  Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;<br>
  Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into<br>
  the dreary desert sand of dead habit;<br>
  Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening<br>
  thought and action -<br>
  Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.
