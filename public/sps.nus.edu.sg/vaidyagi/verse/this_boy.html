  <p>That boy took my love away,<br>
  He'll regret it someday,<br>
  But this boy wants you back again.
  
  <p>That boy isn't good for you,<br>
  Tho' he may want you too,<br>
  This boy wants you back again.
  
  <p>Oh, and this boy would be happy,<br>
  Just to love you, buy oh my-yi-yi,<br>
  That boy won't be happy,<br>
  Till he's seen you cry-hi-hi.
  
  <p>This boy wouldn't mind the pain,<br>
  Would always feel the same,<br>
  If this boy gets you back again.<br>
  This boy. This boy.
