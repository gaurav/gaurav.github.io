  	<p>We got about to chatting...and I discovered that the people who work hardest in this field are often the ones who have lost at least one person, or seen the decline of a dear one, generically, due to disorders of cell death. Come to think of it, those who opted to join this lab and jumped in for the thrashing struggle often are those who took the disease personally and wanted to fight it.<br>
  	We started out bitching about how little doctors know (egoistically, I think I know more than most doctors I've met) and how expensive NUH is...and suddenly someone burst out saying that it was such a waste of money prolonging a life for a paltry few miserable months. The whole family's savings wiped out and the drugs only a minor part of it, the bad doctors and health care, a major part of it. And another remarked that she would rather not have joined this place, but have her mother back.<br>
  	As for me, I knew two ... and I realised the inner rage was the fuel that lit the fires of inspiration for all those pouring their lives out for this cause.<br>
  	When I depart from earth, I'd like this to be said of my work. Certainly, I'd like to deserve it, unlike many of the undeserved epitaphs I've seen. And dedicate this to many of those who have laid down their lives for science, for medicine and just to make life better, at the expense of their lives, their youth and their happiness--for the generations to come.<br>
  	"For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time has come for my departure. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day--and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing." 2 Timothy 4:6-8
