  	<p>"We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful what we pretend to be."
  	<br><b>Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.</b>
  
  <!-- what are people like? -->

  	<p>"A beach house," he said, "doesn't even have to be on the beach. Though the best ones are.<Br>
  	We all like to congregate," he went on, "at boundary conditions."<Br>
  	"Really?" said Arthur.<Br>
  	"Where land meets water. Where earth meets air. Where body meets mind. Where space meets time.<br>
  	We like to be on one side, and look at the other."
  	<br><b>Douglas Adams, <i>Mostly Harmless</i></b>

  	<p>Nobody is one block of harmony. We are all afraid of something, or feel limited in something. We all need somebody to talk to. It would be good if we talked to each other--not just pitter-patter, but real talk. We shouldn't be so afraid, because most people really like this contact; that you show you are vulnerable makes them free to be vulnerable too. It's so much easier to be together when we drop our masks.
  	<br><b>Liv Ullman</b>
  
  <!-- good things about people -->

  	<p>A real person has two reasons for doing anything ... a good reason and the real reason.
  
  	<center>
  	<p>Don't be humble ... you're not that great.
  	<br><b>Golda Meir</b>
  
  <!-- bad things about people -->
  	<centeR>
  	<p>People seem to enjoy things more when they know a lot of other people have been left out on the pleasure.
  	<br><b>Russell Baker</b>
  
  	<p>Everybody is somebody else's weirdo.
  <!-- how to handle people -->
  	<center>
  	<p>The best index to a person's character is a) how he treats people who can't do him any good and b) how he treats people who can't fight back.
  	<br><b>Abigail Van Buren</b>
  
  	<center>
  	<p>Treat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what they are capable of being.
  	<br><b>Goethe</b>
  
  	<p>Never argue with idiots. They drag you down to their level, then
  	beat you with experience.
  
  	<p>To handle yourself, use your head. To handle others, use your heart.
  	<br><b>Eleanor Roosevelt</b>
  <!-- why people are good -->
  
  	<p>    	No man is an island, entire of itself; <br>
  		every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. <Br>
  		If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, <br>
  		as well as if a promontory were, <br>
  		as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were. <br>
  		Any man's death diminishes me because I am involved in mankind;<br> 
  		and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. 
  	<br><b>John Donne</b>
